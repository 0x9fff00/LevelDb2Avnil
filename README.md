# LevelDb2Anvil

Convert Minecraft: Pocket Edition Maps(LevelDB) to Minecraft Maps(Anvil) or reversely.

## Warning:

The converter will experience an error if you have blocks which are not supported by Minecraft PC Edition. It will make your .mca files corrupted, therefore please replace those blocks with another block that is supported.

## Usage:

There's a video tutorial about this(Made by AntVenom): [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFAkc5L4h48)

Import your LevelDB world in and rename it to the name 'world'.
Run start.bat(if you're on Windows) or start.sh(if you're on OS X or Linux) and the converter will now convert it to Anvil format to the output folder of 'worldanvil'.

If you were familiar with command line interface, using the Converter.jar like this(You may want to [install java runtime first](java.com)): 

```
java -jar Converter.jar <import folder> <export folder>
```

## Screenshots:

The mca files generated by the program stores your maps data. They can be found in an usual Minecraft world folder:

Create a superflat new world and copy the mca files into it, open the game and locate your chunks.(Press F3 to see your location)
Don't worry if you were seeing the flat chunks again, the coordinate of your original chunk in the MCPE is exactly the same in here too, you may want to use teleport command to find the chunks.
